#TODO
<b>Get feedback during the mid of the sprint from Garbiele and Imed about the SAD and other documents we will hand in</b><br />
Stats: switching graphs and timeframes should work<br />
Front end: front page look happy<br />
Front end: tooltips on buttons / button design<br />
Document the history_timestamp option<br />

Check spaces in search terms<br />

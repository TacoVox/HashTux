#TODO

- Terms of use text that says "btw we use cookies, and we store information about what users search for to provide a better user experience" - and also the Privacy Policy info from Instagram as below.<br />
- Posts should have higher chance of appearing in RECENT the newer they are<br />
- In main UI, show RELATED searches (users that searched for X also searched for Y1-Y5). This is a big one, should maybe be it's own user story.<br />
- For history especially, maybe all the time though, posts should have a higher chance of appearing if they have more likes.<br />

#Documentation:
- Testing
- Design patterns?

#During the christmas break:
- Stats final visual touch
- Check the testing/validations lecture slides, and check that all servers are configured properly and that shutting down apache or erlang on 1-3 servers does not bring down the system from a user perspective
- Code review
- Add links to our social media profiles: facebook, insta, twitter
- Instagram: Fix the location to be proper format

#TODO
<b>Get feedback during the mid of the sprint from Garbiele and Imed about the SAD and other documents we will hand in</b><br />
Stats: switching graphs and timeframes should work<br />
<s>Front end: front page look happy</s><br />
<s>Front end: tooltips on buttons / button design</s><br />
Document the history_timestamp option, BTW maybe combine the options datatype with the database options list and clarify which can be used where.<br />
Front end: videos tweaked<br />
Front end: visible button for freezing all<br />
Front end: clarify that it's TILE SIZE that is small/medium/large or otherwiese clarify so it makes sense (size: large can almost feel like you're saying you have a large screen, so more tiles would fit). I'd almost rather have it named something else, like tile amount... but can't come up with the best term right now // J<br />
Check spaces in search terms, and decide which special characters should be allowed<br />
Close buttons on options?<br />
Check the testing/validations lecture slides, and check that all servers are configured properly and that shutting down apache or erlang on 1-3 servers does not bring down the system from a user perspective<br />

Front end: maybe list of trending things on the first page<br />
Error report / defect backlog - maybe link "click here to report problems"<br />
Free for personal use, paid for commercial use.<br />
Back button<br />

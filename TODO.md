#TODO
<b>bugs.hashtux.com - please create subdomain and point it to derkahler.de</b>

- <b>Get feedback during the mid of the sprint from Garbiele and Imed about the SAD and other documents we will hand in</b><br />
- <b>Instagram timescroll is not working, pictures from yesterday are showing up when you set it to i.e. 1 week ago. We will probably omit instagram from timescroll, but let's discuss tomorrow</b><br />
- Terms of use text that says "btw we use cookies, and we store information about what users search for to provide a better user experience".<br />
- Stats: take away leftmost hashtux link (confusing), set default to at least 25 entries and maybe week. add some space under the table. add numbers to all entries in the table, in order of popularity/occurence<br />
- Front end: videos tweaked<br />
- Posts should have higher chance of appearing in RECENT the newer they are<br />
- Close button at top right in options meny?<br />
- "Back to front page" button and icon in top menu<br />
- Front end: maybe list of trending things on the first page <b>Ideally both from HashTux search stats AND trending on twitter</b><br />
- Error report / defect backlog - maybe link "click here to report problems"<br />
- In stats and possibly in main UI, show RELATED searches (users that searched for X also searched for Y1-Y5).<br />
- For history especially, maybe all the time though, posts should have a higher chance of appearing if they have more likes.<br />


#Documentation:
Make a point that the project is well defined in scope<br />
Make a point that the project is simple/intuitive by design choise in terms of UI etc<br />
Maybe combine the options datatype with the database options list and clarify which can be used where.<br />

*fix the redeployment diagram (done)<br /> 
-->arrows<br /> 
-->external service<br />
-->naming servers properly <br />

#During the christmas break:
Stats final visual touch<br />
Check the testing/validations lecture slides, and check that all servers are configured properly and that shutting down apache or erlang on 1-3 servers does not bring down the system from a user perspective<br />

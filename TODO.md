#TODO
<b>Get feedback during the mid of the sprint from Garbiele and Imed about the SAD and other documents we will hand in</b><br />
Stats: switching graphs and timeframes should work<br />
Move youtube and instagram configs to config file<br />
<s>Front end: front page look happy</s><br />
<s>Regex check in PHP: see if \w is a good alternative to let through word characters (not enough)</s><br />
<s>Front end: tooltips on buttons / button design</s><br />
<s>Check spaces in search terms, and decide which special characters should be allowed</s><br />
<s>Front end: forward and backward button in browser should work reasonably</s><br />
<s>Document the history_timestamp option</s><br />
<s>Free for personal use, paid for commercial use text.</s><br />
Popup if you click commercial use, with license and pay button<br />
Front end: videos tweaked<br />
For history especially, maybe all the time though, posts should have a higher chance of appearing if they have more likes.<br />
Front end: visible button for freezing all<br />
Front end: clarify that it's TILE SIZE that is small/medium/large or otherwiese clarify so it makes sense (size: large can almost feel like you're saying you have a large screen, so more tiles would fit). I'd almost rather have it named something else, like tile amount... but can't come up with the best term right now // J<br />
Close button at top right in options meny?<br />

Front end: maybe list of trending things on the first page<br />
Error report / defect backlog - maybe link "click here to report problems"<br />
"Back to front page" button and icon in top menu<br />
In stats and possibly in main UI, show RELATED searches (users that searched for X also searched for Y1-Y5).<br />



#Documentation:
Make a point that the project is well defined in scope<br />
Make a point that the project is simple/intuitive by design choise in terms of UI etc<br />
Maybe combine the options datatype with the database options list and clarify which can be used where.<br />

*fix the redeployment diagram 
-->arrows<br /> 
-->external service<br />
-->naming servers properly <br />
-->port 88 should be open (Jerker) <br />

#During the christmas break:
Stats final visual touch<br />
Check the testing/validations lecture slides, and check that all servers are configured properly and that shutting down apache or erlang on 1-3 servers does not bring down the system from a user perspective<br />
Code review <br/>

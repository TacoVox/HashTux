#TODO

- <b>Get feedback during the mid of the sprint from Garbiele and Imed about the SAD and other documents we will hand in</b><br />
- Jerker: Front end: maybe list of trending things on the first page <b>Ideally both from HashTux search stats AND trending on twitter</b><br />
- Dennis: Front end: videos tweaked<br />
- Terms of use text that says "btw we use cookies, and we store information about what users search for to provide a better user experience".<br />
- Aman: Stats:add some space under the table.
- add a total that is the total number av searches for the given interval<br />
- Posts should have higher chance of appearing in RECENT the newer they are<br />
- Error report / defect backlog - maybe link "click here to report problems"<br />
- In stats and possibly in main UI, show RELATED searches (users that searched for X also searched for Y1-Y5).<br />
- For history especially, maybe all the time though, posts should have a higher chance of appearing if they have more likes.<br />
- Index page should link to stats page
- Dennis: Use another word than "Hashtag" on the front page, (we don't use hashtax on youtube etc).
- Dennis: Action buttos in tweets (like etc.) to conform with the twitter guidelines. 
- Front-end: Ipad is scrolling, can not search when in grid page.
- Fix indentation in index.php, search.php etc

#Documentation:
Make a point that the project is well defined in scope<br />
Make a point that the project is simple/intuitive by design choise in terms of UI etc<br />
Maybe combine the options datatype with the database options list and clarify which can be used where.<br />

*fix the redeployment diagram (done)<br /> 
-->arrows<br /> 
-->external service<br />
-->naming servers properly <br />

#During the christmas break:
Stats final visual touch<br />
Check the testing/validations lecture slides, and check that all servers are configured properly and that shutting down apache or erlang on 1-3 servers does not bring down the system from a user perspective<br />

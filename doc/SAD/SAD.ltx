% Product Vision
\section{Product Vision (Updated)}
\begin{quote}
\textit{``Tagline: HashTux is a platform for easy access to multiple social
media feeds based on user search where the user has the option to filter
information based on his or her preferences.''}
\end{quote}
{\it HashTux} is a web based service that displays the latest pictures, videos
and other social media posts for a given hashtag. Media content is fetched from
multiple social media sources and displayed in a web interface optimized for
fullscreen view ideal for a conference or event context, having a screen
illustrating different viewpoints of the chosen keyword subject. \\

As time passes, the different content objects come and go, new ones fade in
replacing the old ones. Videos start playing automatically. The objects on the
screen are ordered automatically so that all space on the screen is used
properly. \\

There is already successful software that does something similar but with slight
differences, like including only twitter (Tweetdeck). Our selling point is that
we include content from multiple sources (also including instagram and youtube,
designed with a modular implementation that easily allows adding more) and also
combine it with multiple media formats, including videos automatically playing.
To fetch older information we want to include a time scroll functionality. \\

To ensure the system is available even in the case of a failure or maintenance
in one or more servers, our goal is to have the system running on several
servers. As a part of the constraints, a significant part of the software will
be implemented in Erlang. We were also encouraged to use a NoSQL database, and
therefore use CouchDB. \newpage

% Target audience
\section{Target Audience}
\begin{description}
  \item[Event and conference hosts.] \hfill \\
  To easily show the latest multimedia from an event.
  \item[Social media users.] \hfill \\
  For the ease of use, fun experience, and the nice overview provided by our
  all-in-one solution.
  \item[General commercial use.] \hfill \\
  Illustrate recent updates for a product or company name or other term.
\end{description}

% Domain
\section{Domain}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Information
  \item Social Media
  \item Trends
\end{itemize}
Giving internet users easy access to multimedia content for a particular search
term, as well as information on current trends in search habits and on social
media.

% Business Cases
\section{Business Cases}
\begin{description}
  \item[Main business case] \hfill \\
  Our service is free for personal use, but requires buying a licence for
  commercial use. Right now we have the alternatives of buying either a 1-year
  license for \EUR{9.99}, or a lifetime licence for \EUR{29.99}.
  \item[Secondary business cases] \hfill
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Aim for an acquisition by a third party.
    \item Collect general data about user habits, which could be valuable
          especially if we choose to integrate with a larger company that tracks
          user behaviour for marketing purposes or similar. \\
          Examples: search terms, related search terms, trends.
   \end{itemize}
\end{description}
We also have a donate button that lets users to donate money if they want to.

% Scope
\section{Scope}
The main purpose of our application is to provide the users with content
gathered from several popular social media platforms and show it in an appealing
way in the user’s web browser. \newline
For this project we decided to integrate Twitter, Instagram and Youtube as our
data sources. After the end of this University project, we will possibly add
more services (see \hyperlink{future}{Future}). \\

The application comes with a time scroll functionality which supports Twitter
and Youtube. Instagram is not supported at this time due to API limitations.
\newline
Our application is easily deployable and uses CouchDB as the data storage for
user habit data as well as the applications cache. \\

From the beginning we wanted HashTux to have a very clean, uncluttered user
interface to emphasize how easy it is to use. We also wanted to avoid a trap we
fell into during our last terms project, of adding more and more features and
not having enough time in the end to wrap up, debug and document everything
properly. This is why we have focused quite a lot of our attention on things
like availability tactics and making the whole application resilient, instead of
adding a lot of flashy features. \\

We also consider improving this product after the scope of this university
project, which is why we have also put some effort into providing a good
infrastructure for that, such as using an issue tracker.

% Quality Reqs and Secenario Analysis
\section{Quality Requirements and Scenario Analysis}
Quality requirements for our project in order of significance (most important
first). Quality scenarios are provided for each quality attribute as well as a
brief description. For tactics addressing the QA mentioned, see
\hyperlink{tactics}{Tactics}.

%Availability
\subsection{Availability}
Our goal for the product is to have an uptime of 99.999\%. This value is
expected when running the full server-side component stack on 3 servers or more.
For a lower number of servers running the stack, we expect an uptime of the
system of 99\%.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{availability_scenario.png}
  \caption{Availabilty Scenerio}
\end{figure}

% Performance
\subsection{Performance}
The system needs to respond quickly enough for the user not to be discouraged
from using our product. On average requests should be processed in less than
5sec. Database operations should be performed, on average, in less than 1sec.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{performance_scenario.png}
  \caption{Performance Scenerio}
\end{figure}

% Modifiabilty
\subsection{Modifiability}
The system should be designed to support easy modification. This requires aiming
for having loosely coupled modules and a clear separation of concerns. For
example, adding new modules to support different social media services should
require low effort from the development team.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{modifiability_scenario.png}
  \caption{Modifiability Scenerio}
\end{figure}

\newpage

% Usability
\subsection{Usability}
The system should be easy to use in an intuitive way. This is hard to quantify,
but we want our application to be as easy to use as the social media services we
get content from, i.e. the typical user shouldn't have to consult a user manual
to understand the provided features and options.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{usability_scenario.png}
  \caption{Usability Scenerio}
\end{figure}

% Security
\subsection{Security}
The system should have security mechanisms to prevent DDoS attacks and
unauthorised access to our databases. Security is not our primary concern
because we do not store or deal in any way with sensitive data like user login
credentials or bank accounts. However, to guarantee availability, we must aim to
minimize security vulnerabilities, both when designing, implementing and
deploying our system.

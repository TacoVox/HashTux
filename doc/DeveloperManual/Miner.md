# Miners
=================================================================
##To start the entire tree for the miner (supervisors + workers)
```erlang
miner_sup:start_link().
```

##To search for a hashtag
```erlang
miner_server:search(Term, Options).
```
The above function returns `{ok, Pid}` where `Pid` is the process identifier of the spawned worker to do the search.

**Term** is the term (hashtag) to search for, passed as a string, eg:
```erlang
miner_server:search("mario", Options).
```
**Options** is a list containing {key, value} pairs. Key is an `atom` and value is a `binary`. Following {key, value} pairs are supported:
```erlang
{service, List}
```
`List` is an erlang list containing the services we want to search for in binary format. Services supported are **instagram**, **twitter**, **youtube**.For example, `{service, [<<"instagram">>, <<"twitter">>]}`. To search for all services available, either leave the list empty `[]` or omit this {key, value} pair.
```erlang
{content_type, List}
```
`List` is an erlang list containing the content types we want to search for in binary format. Content types supported are **image**, **video**, **text**. For example, `{content_type, [<<"image>>]}`. To search for all content types available, either leave the list empty `[]` or omit this {key, value} pair.
```erlang
{language, Value}
```
`Value` is an erlang binary denoting the language. Languages supported are **en**, **sv**, **it**, **bg**, **de**, **es**, **fr** and **am** (Aman special :sunglasses:). For example, `{language, <<"en">>}`. To search for all languages available, omit this {key, value} pair.
```erlang
{history_timestamp, Seconds}
```
`Seconds` is an integer specifying the timestamp in seconds. For example, `{history_timestamp, 123456}`. To search for results for a concrete timeframe, include the foremention {key, value} pair. Otherwise, omit this {key, value} pair.
```erlang
{request_type, Type}
```
`Type` is an erlang binary specifying the type of the request. Typer supported are **search**, **update** and **heartbeat**. For example, `{request_type, <<"search">>}`. **OBS** This {key, value} pair **must always** be included in the options.

##Heartbeat only
```erlang
miner_server:heartbeat(Term, Options).
```
`Term` and `Options` are the same as described above. The only difference is that the above call does not return anything.

##Example calls
Searches only instagram and twitter for any language and content type, and for the latest posts, twitts, etc.
```erlang
miner_server:search("mario", [{service, [<<"instagram">>, <<"twitter">>]}, {request_type, <<"search">>}]).
```
Searches all services for specified language and content type, and for the latest posts, twitts, etc.
```erlang
miner_server:search("mario", [{service, []}, {content_type, [<<"video">>]}, {language, <<"en">>}, {request_type, <<"search">>}]).
```
The above call can also be written as following, omitting the service {key, value} pair.
```erlang
miner_server:search("mario", [{content_type, [<<"video">>]}, {language, <<"en">>}, {request_type, <<"search">>}]).
```
To search for a certain timeframe, just include the {history_timestamp, 123456} pair.

####Again, don't forget the `{request_type, Type}` pair in each call. :eyes:


### Sequence of operations when `miner_server:search/2` called:
1. A new worker is spawned to search for the given term (hashtag). The PID of the worker is returned to the caller for reference.
2. After the search is complete, the worker returns the search results to the original caller.

### Sample use:
```erlang
{ok, Pid} = miner_server:search("mario", [{request_type, <<"search">>}]).
receive {Pid, Result} -> Result end.
```
